# Theme, icon and cursors

Most themes, icons and cursors are available on www.pling.com:

* For GTK desktops environments(MATE, GNOME, Budgie): https://www.pling.com/browse?cat=366&ord=latest
* For Qt Desktop (KDE): https://www.pling.com/browse?cat=121&ord=latest

i recommend looking at [Orchis](https://www.pling.com/p/1357889), [Skeuos](https://www.pling.com/p/1441725/), themes for GTK and [Edna](https://www.pling.com/p/1367060), [Otto](https://www.pling.com/p/1360125), [Moe](https://www.pling.com/p/1338879) themes for KDE Plasma
Other themes such as [Materia](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme), [Plata](https://gitlab.com/tista500/plata-theme) is available in official repository 
For install themes use internal scripts or this coomand (after unarchive):

```bash
sudo cp -r /home/$USER/'your directory' /usr/share/themes # for themes 
```
```bash
sudo cp -r /home/$USER/'your directory' /usr/share/icons # for icons and cursors
```

# Fonts

Many fonts which use without subscription or buy is available in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
To install fonts, I recommend using `gnome-font-viewer` or copy fonts in `~/.local/share/fonts`
I personally use Inter font with 11 pt size for Interface
